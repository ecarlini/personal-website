title: ACCORDION
summary: I was the coordinator of the ACCORDION project, a 3-year venture ended in April 2023. ACCORDION established an opportunistic approach in bringing together edge resource/infrastructures (public clouds, on-premise infrastructures, telco resources, end-devices) in pools defined in terms of latency, which can support NextGen application requirements.
