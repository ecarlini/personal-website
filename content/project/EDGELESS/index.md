title: EDGELESS
summary: EDGELESS project aims to leverage the serverless concept in all the layers in the edge-cloud continuum to fully benefit from diverse and decentralised computational resources available on-demand close to where data are produced or consumed. In particular, we aim at realising an efficient and transparent horizontal pooling of the resources on edge nodes with constrained capabilities or specialised hardware, smoothly integrated with cloud resources, which is a giant leap forward compared to state-of-the-art vertical offloading solutions where the edge is a mere supplement of the cloud.
